This application is designed to extract prompts from a batch of PNG images generated by the Stable Diffusion process. It provides both a console version and a web interface for ease of use.

## Console Version:
1. Run the Python script in your console. You'll need to have Python installed on your machine.
2. When prompted, enter the path to the directory containing your PNG images.
3. The script will then rename all the PNG files in the directory based on their order.
4. Next, it will extract the prompts from each renamed file.
5. The extracted prompts are then written to a new .txt file with the same name as each image.

## Web Interface:
1. Launch the web interface by running the Gradio interface in your Python environment.
2. In the first interface, enter the path to your directory and click 'Submit'. This will display a list of all PNG files in your directory.
3. In the second interface, enter the same directory path in the first textbox. The second textbox is used to display progress updates.
4. Click 'Submit' to start processing the images. The progress updates will be displayed in real time in the second textbox.
5. Once processing is complete, you'll find that each image file has been renamed based on its order, and a corresponding .txt file has been created with the extracted prompts.

Please note that you'll need to have certain Python libraries installed to run this application, including `PIL` (Pillow) for image processing and `gradio` for the web interface.
